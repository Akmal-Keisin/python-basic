# Hello World

## Your First Python Program

The first program you write in any programming language is typically a "Hello World" program. This simple program introduces you to the basic syntax and structure of the language.

## Using the print() Function

In Python, the `print()` function is used to display output to the console. It's one of the most fundamental functions you'll use throughout your Python journey.

### Basic Syntax
```python
print('hello world')
```

### Key Points
- The `print()` function outputs text or values to the console
- You can use either **single quotes** (`'`) or **double quotes** (`"`) to define strings
- Python automatically adds a newline after printing

### Common Uses
- Display messages to users
- Debug your code by showing variable values
- Output results of calculations or operations
